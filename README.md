# HR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
## Project Objective:
Assist an organisation in improving employee retention (reduce attrition) and enhance workforce performance by analyzing various trends based on the available data.

## Description:
This is a project done using the Power BI Desktop version by importing a sample open source employee data from a CSV file. I have utilised a few key parameters to analyze the attrition rate. This has been done with the help of multiple visualizations that are visible on the dashboard.

## Project Learnings:
1. Identified key factors to reduce attrition across various parameters like Salary, Department, Tenure etc.
2. Improved the hiring process by focussing on the pain points of employees
3. Helped the HR department take further steps to improve the learning and compensation plans for future retentions
